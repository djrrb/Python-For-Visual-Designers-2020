# Python-For-Visual-Designers-2020

* Type@Cooper Public Workshop Fall 2020
* Tuesdays 7–9pm ET, October 13 to November 10 (5 sessions)
* Instructor: [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com)

## Course Description

Designers use tools to help us get our work done, but we rarely consider how much these tools can box us in to certain processes and solutions in our work. Creating our own tools can lead us down new and unexpected avenues in our designs: some of the best visual ideas can come about by setting up some boundaries — a color palette, a typeface or two — and then running wild within the system. And working out a system in code is a great way to explore these ideas: computers love repetition and can quickly make hundreds of variations on a theme, and mistakes in the code can result in something that often looks better than what was originally intended.

With no programming experience necessary, workshop participants will learn the basics of the Python programming language while working in the free DrawBot application for MacOS. A quick sketch made with code in DrawBot can be saved as a PDF as a starting point to be finished later in Illustrator, or, with a little bit more work in the code editor, an entire book, magazine or animation can be built without even launching Illustrator or InDesign.

Using the fundamentals of the Python programming language, students will sketch to create vector art with code and use the basic principles of design to turn their sketches into PDF zines and animated gifs.

### Required Materials

* A Laptop with macOS 10.9 (Mavericks) or newer
