Wouldn‚Äôt that bring about chaos? They were just sucked into space. Travel time to the nearest starbase? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. I‚Äôll be sure to note that in my log. I can‚Äôt. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Well, I‚Äôll say this for him - he‚Äôs sure of himself. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named ‚ÄúEnterprise.‚Äù The Federation‚Äôs gone; the Borg is everywhere! How long can two people talk about nothing? Your shields were failing, sir. I‚Äôm afraid I still don‚Äôt understand, sir. What? We‚Äôre not at all alike! Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Sure. You‚Äôd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. You bet I‚Äôm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Besides, you look good in a dress. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. What‚Äôs a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Well, that‚Äôs certainly good to know. This should be interesting. Congratulations, you just destroyed the Enterprise. We have a saboteur aboard. Your head is not an artifact! Sorry, Data. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. That might‚Äôve been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I guess it‚Äôs better to be lucky than good. You enjoyed that. The unexpected is our normal routine. Not if I weaken first. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who‚Äôs asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. You‚Äôre going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Now we know what they mean by ‚Äòadvanced‚Äô tactical training. Worf, It‚Äôs better than music. It‚Äôs jazz. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. The game‚Äôs not big enough unless it scares you a little. Damage report! I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Wait a minute - you‚Äôve been declared dead. You can‚Äôt give orders around here. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Talk about going nowhere fast. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Computer, belay that order. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? We know you‚Äôre dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Computer, lights up! Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. I am your worst nightmare! Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Smooth as an android‚Äôs bottom, eh, Data? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.
