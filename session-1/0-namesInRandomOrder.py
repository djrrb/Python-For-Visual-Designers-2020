# i used three quotes """ to designate a multi-line string

Cameron Balmer

# to convert these names into a proper python list, we will split the string every time we encounter a newline ('\n')
namesList = theNames.split('\n')

# now that we have a list, we can put its contents in a random order using the shuffle() function, which lives in the random library
random.shuffle(namesList)

# now that the list is randomized
# we can loop through it and print each result in the random order
# for each name in our list, we will assign it to the variable theName
for theName in namesList:
    # i only want to print first names
    # so I will split the name by tabs, and grab the first item from that list
    firstName = theName.split('\t')[0]
